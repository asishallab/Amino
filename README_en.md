# Amino

We have developed Amino, an entertaining strategic tile based game for the whole family. Amino takes players on a journey into the microcosm of ants. Click [here](https://youtu.be/A8bVc14q32A) for a short demonstration video on YouTube.

Amino introduces a new triangular tile based mechanism for building a maze of pathways. The triangular shape itself and the six different types of tiles enable the players to build a maze surprisingly dense, diverse, and with very winding paths. These characteristics are not possible when for example using quadratic or hexagonal tiles. The method was inspired by results from theoretical Biology. 

We were able to have Amino tested by Prof. Markus Wiemker ([media Akademie - University of Stuttgart](https://www.media-hs.de/); [wiemker.org](www.wiemker.org)). He reviewed: "Amino is a complex, strategic tile game that is characterized by a high level of replay value, diverse tactical possibilities, good balancing and has integrated a proven combat system."

Amino has been developed by us in the last six years. We have tested it in over 300 trial games and with more than 40 players. The game is fun for two players, but also in larger groups of up to six friends. The playing time is short and crisp, depending on the number of players between 15 to 60 minutes. So far we haven't reached a practical upper limit for the number of players. With extensions we have played Amino with up to ten participants (playing time here was just under 2 hours).

We would be very happy if Amino catches your eye and gladly would send you a prototype upon request.

As we say in Germany: Good luck in game and in love!
