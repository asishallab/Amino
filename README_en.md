# Amino

We have developed Amino, an entertaining strategic tile based game for the whole family. Amino takes players on a journey into the microcosm of ants. Click [here](https://youtu.be/A8bVc14q32A) for a short demonstration video on YouTube.

We were able to have Amino tested by Prof. Markus Wiemker ([media Akademie - University of Stuttgart](https://www.media-hs.de/); [wiemker.org](www.wiemker.org)). His rating was: "Amino is a complex, strategic tile game that is characterized by a high level of replay value, diverse tactical possibilities, good balancing and has integrated of a proven combat system."

Amino has been developed by us during the last six years. We have tested it in over 300 times and with more than 40 players. The game is fun for two players, but also in larger groups of up to six friends. The playing time is short and crisp, depending on the number of players between 15 to 60 minutes. So far we haven't reached a practical upper limit of player number. With extensions we have played Amino with up to ten participants (playing time here was about 2 hours).

We would be very happy if Amino catches your eye and gladly would send you a prototype upon request.

As we say in Germany: Good luck in game and in love!
